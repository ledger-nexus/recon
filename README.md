# recon

> AI-assisted bank reconciliation on top of the `ledger-core` substrate. AI suggests; humans approve; ledger-core posts.

Companion repo to [`ledger-core`](https://github.com/ledger-nexus/ledger-core). Reads journal entries from the shared Postgres database, ingests bank statement CSVs, proposes matches between bank lines and ledger journal lines, and posts adjustment entries back through ledger-core's `postJournalEntry` — never bypassing the posting boundary.

**The security posture is the headline.** v0.1 shipped the deterministic matcher and the CSV pipeline. v0.2 closes the loop: Claude Haiku proposes matches with prompt caching on, humans approve or reject inline, and every AI run is logged to `AiSuggestion` for audit. AI never writes to the ledger directly — adjustment-JE posting (the path into `postJournalEntry`) lands in v0.2-beta.

---

## Architecture in one sentence

`recon` queries ledger-core's tables (read-only), maintains its own (`BankStatement`, `BankStatementLine`, `ReconciliationMatch`, `AiSuggestion`), and writes back to the ledger via ledger-core's posting function with `source: "AI_APPROVED"` after explicit human review.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the relationship to ledger-core in detail.

## What's wired (v0.2)

- ✅ Prisma schema: 6 ledger-core mirrored models + 5 recon-owned models (`BankAccount`, `BankStatement`, `BankStatementLine`, `ReconciliationMatch`, `AiSuggestion`)
- ✅ Bank statement CSV parser with built-in reconciliation check (Σ lines = Δ balance, fails loud if not)
- ✅ Deterministic match scorer (amount + date proximity + description tokens; weighted 0.6 / 0.25 / 0.15) with `AUTO_PROPOSE_THRESHOLD = 0.85`
- ✅ **AI match suggester** (`src/lib/matching/ai-suggest.ts`) — Claude Haiku 4.5 via the official SDK, forced-tool-use structured output, prompt caching ON for the system prefix, hallucinated `journalLineId` filtering
- ✅ **Candidate-fetching helper** (`src/lib/matching/candidates.ts`) — pulls JE lines from ledger-core's cash account by signed-amount + ±5-day window, excludes already-approved matches
- ✅ **Server Actions** (`src/app/actions/`) — `proposeMatchesAction` (runs deterministic, escalates to AI if score < 0.85, persists everything to `AiSuggestion` for audit), `approveMatchAction`, `rejectMatchAction`
- ✅ **Interactive UI** on `/statements/[id]` — per-line "Suggest matches" button, ranked proposal cards with source badges (AI / DETERMINISTIC), inline Approve / Reject
- ✅ Seed: ties to ledger-core's Northwind seed, creates a sample BankAccount + parsed March 2026 statement
- ✅ Unit tests for parser + scorer + AI suggester (with mocked Anthropic client — no live API calls in CI)

## What landed in v0.2-beta

- ✅ **Cross-repo HTTP bridge** ([`src/lib/ledger-bridge.ts`](src/lib/ledger-bridge.ts)) — recon POSTs to ledger-core's `/api/internal/journal-entries` endpoint (token-gated) to create journal entries. The boundary IS `postJournalEntry`; making it network-shaped keeps each repo's types clean and matches the architectural narrative. See [`docs/ledger-bridge.md`](docs/ledger-bridge.md).
- ✅ **Adjustment-JE Server Action** ([`src/app/actions/post-adjustment.ts`](src/app/actions/post-adjustment.ts)) — for UNMATCHED bank lines that need a brand-new JE (e.g. a $50 wire fee never booked). Builds a balanced two-line cash + counter-account entry, POSTs via the bridge with `source: "MANUAL"`, creates an APPROVED `ReconciliationMatch` linked to the new entry, flips the bank line to `ADJUSTMENT`.
- ✅ **Inline adjustment form** on `/statements/[id]` — sits next to "Suggest matches" on UNMATCHED lines.

This closes the loop: AI proposes → human approves OR posts an adjustment → ledger-core writes the entry. AI never touches the ledger.

## What lands next (v0.3 ideas)

## Quick start

```bash
# Prereq: ledger-core seeded against the same DATABASE_URL
git clone https://github.com/ledger-nexus/recon.git
cd recon
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
# Point DATABASE_URL at the same Postgres ledger-core uses

pnpm db:push      # adds bank_account, bank_statement, etc. on top of ledger-core's tables
pnpm db:seed      # creates the sample BankAccount + parsed March 2026 statement
pnpm dev          # http://localhost:3001 — note: different port than ledger-core (3000)
pnpm test         # CSV parser + matching scorer
```

## Tech stack

Same as ledger-core: Next.js 14 (App Router), Postgres + Prisma, decimal.js for money math, Vitest for tests, Tailwind for styling. AI suggestions via `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (Claude Haiku 4.5 with prompt caching).
